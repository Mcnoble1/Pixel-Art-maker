This is set of codes on the pixel art maker which is a project for Front end developers from the ALCwithGoogle 3.0 scholarship.

It works by taking inputs from users by specifying the number of grids(grid's height and width) the user wants to design upon(the canvas) after which the user can also choose the color he/she wants to work with and even mix colors for the artwork he/she wants to design.
